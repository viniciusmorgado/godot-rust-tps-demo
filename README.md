# godot-rust-tps-demo

A Rust rewrite of the official Godot [Third Person Shooter Demo](https://github.com/godotengine/tps-demo),
using [godot-rust (gdext)](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext) — Godot 4.7, `godot` crate 0.5.5.

The original demo is written in GDScript. This repository replaces **every** script with a Rust
class registered through GDExtension; the scenes, models, textures, audio and lightmaps are the
original ones.

## Layout

```
oxide-godot/          Godot 4.7 project (scenes + assets from the original demo, extension.gdextension)
oxide_godot_core/     Cargo workspace; crate `oxide_godot` (cdylib) in oxide_godot_lib/
docs/                 port order, upstream bugs found and fixed, v2 backlog
specs/                Spec Kit specifications, plans and tasks for each milestone
```

## Building and running

```bash
cd oxide_godot_core && cargo build
```

Then open `oxide-godot/project.godot` in Godot 4.7 and run. The debug build of the library is
loaded by `oxide-godot/extension.gdextension`.
